# FFTIndexing.jl

A package providing types that assist with indexing objects in a manner that allows for convenient
interpretation of the results of Fourier transforms.

## Usage

The `FFTIndex` object serves a purpose analogous to Julia's `CartesianIndex`, but uses the frequency
bins generated by a Fourier transform instead of the provided array indices. This means there are
two key differences: `FFTIndex` *always* provides zero-based indexing for an array, and it
guarantees an inbounds array access due to the periodic boundary conditions assumed by the Fourier
transform. For `AbstractArray` instances, the exclusive use of `FFTIndex` for indexing will remove
the bounds check - no `@inbounds` annotation needed.

The `FFTAxis` object serves a purpose analogous to `Base.OneTo`, and represents the frequency bins
generated by a Fourier transform. The `FFTAxis` objects associated with an indexable object `A` can
be generated with `fftaxes(A)`.

The `FFTIndices` object serves a purpose analogous to `CartesianIndices`, and can be constructed
from a `Tuple` of integers representing sizes or ranges representing axes, or from the indexable
object directly.
